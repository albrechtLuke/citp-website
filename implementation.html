                        <p class="phase-duration">Duration: 3-6 weeks</p>
                        <p>This phase focuses on finalising the mechanical and electronic design of the buoy system. Tasks include CAD modeling of the buoy and encoder housing, selection of components such as the solar panels, microcontroller, and linear encoder, and fabrication of a small-scale prototype for initial testing. Software development begins here, with the first iteration of the firmware designed to capture, process, and log tidal data locally. Preliminary tests in controlled conditions validate sensor accuracy and power performance before field adaptation.</p>

                            The prototype is deployed in a test environment that replicates Saibai Island’s conditions. This phase focuses on assessing durability, buoyancy stability, solar charging efficiency, and LoRa signal reliability over distance. Data is collected over multiple tidal cycles to verify measurement precision and sensor response. Identified issues, such as waterproofing, calibration errors, or signal loss, are addressed through hardware and firmware refinements. Collaboration with environmental and community advisors ensures the design aligns with ecological and cultural expectations.

                            Following successful testing, the final buoy units are manufactured and installed at designated coastal monitoring points around Saibai Island. The artificial reef foundations are anchored and verified for stability. Each buoy is configured and connected to the local LoRa gateway, which transmits data to a cloud-based server accessible to the Bureau of Meteorology and local authorities. Integration with monitoring dashboards and alert systems is completed, and data pipelines are tested for consistency and security.

                        <p>
                            To further improve our community impact, we plan to assist members of the Saibai community in upskilling in areas of maintenance, focusing specifically on regular checking of the buoy and artificial reefs. These initiatives are not only vital for environmental monitoring and marine health, but also provide long-term benefits to local livelihoods and knowledge sharing within the Torres Strait region. This allows us to better incorporate traditional knowledge of land and ocean management, improving our ability to respect the traditional custodians of Saibai Island.

                            The maintenance of tide sensing buoys is a crucial part of coastal resilience planning. These instruments record real-time data on sea level changes, tidal ranges, and wave patterns, which are essential for understanding the effects of rising sea levels on island communities like Saibai. By training local residents to inspect, clean, calibrate, and repair these devices, we aim to foster community ownership and ensure that the data remains accurate and consistent. This hands-on skill development also reduces reliance on external technicians and allows the Saibai community to respond quickly to equipment issues, particularly during severe weather events when timely data is most important.

                            This community capacity-building initiative supports broader goals of environmental stewardship and economic resilience. Through structured training sessions and mentorship, local participants can gain skills transferable to other marine-based employment opportunities, including eco-tourism, marine science assistance, and fisheries management. In doing so, the Saibai community will not only protect their marine ecosystems but also strengthen their self-sufficiency and employment prospects, a major need as the enrolment in the labour force in Saibai is only 26.8%.

                            In the long-term, our vision is to integrate these maintenance roles into a sustainable local workforce program that combines traditional ecological knowledge with modern marine technology. By equipping the Saibai community with the tools and skills to maintain tide sensing buoys and artificial reefs, we create a model of local empowerment, environmental guardianship, and scientific collaboration that benefits both the people and the ocean environments they depend on.

                        <h3>State Guidelines</h3>
                        <p>
                            At the state level, we adhere to the guidelines outlined in the Buoy mooring authority application process which is provided by the Department of Transport and Main Roads (DoTMR). The DoTMR classifies our buoy design as Category 1, which applies to moorings managed and operated by third-party organisations under approved agreements called mooring managers. These managers work under agreements with Maritime Safety Queensland (MSQ) and set the fees, terms of use and conditions for their moorings. Furthermore, the DoTMR requires that the buoy display its Buoy Mooring Authority number in clear, plain characters at least 50 millimetres high on a light background to ensure visibility under all lighting conditions. Beyond this, the DoTMR mandates adherence to the federal guidelines governing buoy design and appearance. 
                        </p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="glass-card">
                        <h3>Federal Guidelines</h3>
                        <p>
                            Under federal standards, our buoy must comply with IALA (International Association of Marine Aids to Navigation and Lighthouse Authorities) Guidelines, specifically the guidelines found in R1001 Edition 2.0 (2023). Under these guidelines, our buoy is classified as a Special Mark. This is because special Marks serve to identify distinct areas or features within maritime zones. Typical examples include locations used for data collection, environmental protection areas, submarine cables, and artificial reef structures.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            According to these standards as seen in Figure 8, the buoy must be fully yellow in colour. This is to make sure it does not confuse sailors with the similarly coloured cardinal marks, which have a yellow and black colour scheme, as seen in Figure 5. If the buoy has a topmark, it must have a single yellow “X” at the top. Furthermore, while the shape of the buoy can vary, it must not resemble or conflict with cardinal marks which possess a conical shape similar to a traffic cone.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Construction Guidelines</h3>
                        <p>
                            From a construction point of view, the buoy must be durable, weather resistant and able to withstand constant exposure to saltwater, wind and sunlight. As a result, the materials must be UV stabilised to prevent fading and degradation over time. While not mandatory, the guidelines also suggest we add retro-reflective strips and a radar reflector as these make the buoy more visible at night and detectable by vessels’ radar systems, both of which help contribute to safety.

                        <p>
                            Finally, we require a Buoy Mooring Authority from Maritime Safety Queensland to legally deploy the buoy according to Transport Operations (Marine Safety) Act 1994. Since our buoy design falls under category 1, we first need to pay the initial assessment fee of $104.70. Once we obtain our mooring license, we need to discuss payment with the local mooring manager designated by MSQ on Saibai Island. This is because we will need to transport and install the buoy on a suitable vessel that meets MSQ and maritime transport regulations.

                        <h3>Artifical Reef Legislation</h3>
                        <p>
                            In order to successfully deploy the artificial reefs, our design must comply with state and federal environmental legislation. The most important piece of legislation that we must comply with is the Sea Dumping Permit (1984). This permit is mandatory in Australia for the deployment of any artificial structure in marine waters and is used to ensure our design is operated in both an environmentally sound and sustainable manner. Sea dumping permits are only issued if we are able to prove that our artificial reefs provide a clear social or economic benefit. This can include enhancing or concentrating marine flora and fauna populations, to support diving, fishing, and any other sea-based recreational activities. To make sure our design meets these requirements, our project must comply with the Sea Dumping Permit guidelines and complete the official application form available from the Department of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment, and Water (DCCEEW)

                        <h3>Artifical Reef Perimit Application and Duration</h3>
                        <p>
                            The application process for a Sea Dumping Permit is complex, involving multiple rounds of interviews and reviews undertaken by the DCCEEW. The process takes around 12 months to finalise since it involves a comprehensive environmental assessment, engagement with all relevant government ministries and key stakeholders, and the submission of detailed installation and maintenance plans along with a $10,000 application fee. After approval, the license lasts for 30 to 50 years, hence ensuring long-term environmental protection and control throughout the operational lifespan of the reef. In preparation for the interviews, the Artificial Reef guidelines recommend that we consider all stages of the life cycle of the artificial reef, including preparation and deployment (installation), maintenance, repairs and inspection, remediation and rectification work in the event of environmental harm. Additionally, the project must also have provisions for costs associated with having to keep necessary insurances and decommissioning plans in place once the reef comes to the end of its life.
