                        Existing warning systems on Saibai Island are slow, unreliable and extremely dependent on external networks and systems, leaving residents of the island vulnerable when rapid response is most critical. In order to address this, the ideal solution should be locally based, self-sufficient with accurate, real-time warnings especially during dire circumstances.

                            <p class="problem-intro">
                                Saibai island, located in the north-western Torres Strait, is highly vulnerable to storm tides, rising seas, and extreme weather events. With its highest point only 1.7 meters above sea level, even minor tidal surges can lead to severe flooding. Repeated inundation on the island has already caused significant erosion, damaged roads, seawalls, and community facilities, and threatens the long-term habitability of the island.

                            <p class="problem-intro ">
                                Currently, the island does not have any reliable or active tidal monitoring on the island. The sole weather station on the island is offline, leaving no real-time data on sea levels, rainfall, or storm surges. Without this critical information, the community cannot predict hazardous events or issue timely warnings, leaving the residents of Saibai exposed and vulnerable to sudden flooding and storm impacts.

                            <p class="problem-intro">
                                Existing infrastructure is aging, limited and unable to support the community independently during disasters. The island relies on a single 4G tower and diesel-generated power, both of which are extremely prone to failure under extreme weather conditions. This ultimately means that emergency alerts and communication can be lost exactly when they are needed most.

                                Currently, residents of Saibai are informed of emergencies through communication via the government. As the primary form of alert, the Bureau of Meteorology (BOM) initially identifies the emergency, notifies the Queensland State Disaster Coordinator who then communicates it to the Cairns District Disaster Coordinator. This information is then passed to the Torres Strait Local Disaster Management Group and members of the Community Disaster Management Group. By the time the alert reaches residents, it is communicated through multiple channels, including in-person notifications, Emergency Alert SMS or landline messages, local radio broadcasts, official social media platforms, and the Yumi Safe Dashboard.

                            <p class="problem-intro">
                                The biggest issue is that this system requires active human intervention and is susceptible to delays, especially during nighttime or adverse weather conditions, when king tides, typically occurring in winter, are most dangerous. It is further limited by network connectivity, which can face outages in Saibai due to the dependence on the 4G network, as well as power supply issues which can create additional outages during emergencies (EWB, 2025). The lack of reliable network connection is a major issue in communication warnings. Moreover, tidal behaviour can vary significantly even between nearby islands, meaning mainland-sourced data may not accurately reflect local conditions.

                            The proposed solution should be easily integrated with the current systems in place. The design of the solution should allow for expansion and replication for similar remote regions. The components and software should be modular and adaptable to, making upgrades and expansions simple over the long run.

                        <p>
                            The proposed solution must have easy access for regular maintenance and data from the system should be readily available to the community.

                            The solution should be affordable to implement and maintain in the long run, without sacrificing functionality. It should be financially viable for the funding and resource constraints. The solution must also be low maintenance and minimise operational costs.
