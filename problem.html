                        Saibai island, located in the north-western Torres Strait, is highly vulnerable to storm tides, rising seas, and extreme weather events. With its highest point only 1.7 meters above sea level, even minor tidal surges can lead to severe flooding. Repeated inundation on the island has already caused significant erosion, damaged roads, seawalls, and community facilities, and threatens the long-term habitability of the island.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="glass-card challenge-card">
                    <p class="problem-intro ">
                        Currently, the island does not have any reliable or active tidal monitoring on the island. The sole weather station on the island is offline, leaving no real-time data on sea levels, rainfall, or storm surges. Without this critical information, the community cannot predict hazardous events or issue timely warnings, leaving the residents of Saibai exposed and vulnerable to sudden flooding and storm impacts.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="glass-card challenge-card">
                    <p class="problem-intro">
                        Existing infrastructure is aging, limited and unable to support the community independently during disasters. The island relies on a single 4G tower and diesel-generated power, both of which are extremely prone to failure under extreme weather conditions. This ultimately means that emergency alerts and communication can be lost exactly when they are needed most.
