                            The island’s lack of tidal monitoring systems and backup infrastructure makes it extremely vulnerable during emergencies. Our solution to these issues is a tide monitoring buoy which will measure the rising sea levels and act as the first point of contact to the island in emergencies. This allows the community to be notified even when cut off from the mainland. The buoys are part of a larger early warning system which will monitor, predict and warn the community about hazardous events. 
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            The buoys have a spherical shape with a float around it to provide extra buoyancy. They are fluorescent yellow and made of closed-cell polyethylene foam which are a lightweight, UV resistant and saltwater resistant material. The buoys are anchored to an artificial reef made of concrete bricks via studless steel chains attached to a cast iron weight.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            Data is transmitted from transceivers on the buoy to receivers on the island’s shore and relayed to the community via Long Range Wide Area Network (LoRaWAN). LoRa is a wireless radio technology that allows low cost, long range, low power communication between systems.  It is based on chirp spread spectrum modulation which encodes information on radio waves using chirp pulses similar to bats and dolphins. 
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            Data is sent periodically every 15min. The data collected from the buoy will also be sent to the relevant authorities such as the Bureau of Meteorology to support broader, coordinated decision making.

                            Polycrystalline solar panels have been added to the float around the buoy as a sustainable power source. They can last around 25-30 years until significantly reduced efficiency due to degradation of panels over time.

                        A studless stainless steel mooring chain anchors the buoy assembly to the weight. The chain provides the primary load path, tolerates abrasion on a sedimentary seabed and keeps the buoy straight above the artificial reef and linear encoder mechanism. We specify marine-grade 316 or galvanised chain with corrosion-resistant coatings and sacrificial components where needed. The chain also acts as the interface for the linear encoder mechanism to measure the height of the buoy, therefore indicating the height of the tide.

                    <p>
                        The rotary encoder records reel rotation to translate line movement into precise tidal height data. A magnetic, marine-grade encoder with IP68 sealing is preferred for reliability in salty, wet environments. Encoder pulses are read by the onboard microcontroller to compute water level changes. Periodic calibration against a known reference ensures ongoing accuracy. Expected operational life is multiple years, subject to protection from mechanical shock and ingress.

                <p>
                    A compact gear system couples the chain to the rotary encoder, converting the linear movements of the buoy moving up and down into rotary motion that can be measured by the rotary encoder. This has a measured reduction ratio so small tidal movements yield high-resolution measurements. Gears are housed in a sealed, grease-filled canister to exclude salt and biofouling and are made from corrosion-resistant materials such as 316 stainless steel or bronze. The gearbox protects the encoder from shock and surge loads and is serviced when lubricant condition or gear wear is detected.

The cable is routed around the chain to go up to the buoy. It has the advantage of being highly low cost, yet durable enough to serve its purpose in the harsh conditions.

                            The buoys will be anchored in place by artificial reefs constructed of cinderblock. This supports marine biodiversity, which in turn encourages traditional activities such as cultural fishing, which upholds our major stakeholders’ interests.

                        <p>
                            The high calcium content of cinderblock helps to bolster the shell development of invertebrates, by raising the pH level and leading to more readily available carbonate ions, a necessary molecule for shell development. Additionally, the presence of artificial reefs in the path of tide pathways limits some of the wave energy being exerted upon the shoreline. This has shown promise in locations in Puerto Rico, Mauritius, and France, in reducing coastal erosion and longshore drift.

                            The interests of our stakeholders, the Saibai Islander residents and elders, are vital to the continuity of our project. Due to the principle of Aisland Custome (Island Custom), no actions can be taken on Siabai Island and its associated waterways without the input and approval of the native Peoples. This is due to the sociohistorical context of the Saibai Islanders, with Western Culture threatening to overtake their traditional ways of life. We are combatting this idea by facilitating traditional fishing and foraging, bolstered by the increase of native fauna and flora around our constructed artificial reefs. Under the Native Title Act of 1993, cultural fishing is allowed in the vicinity of reefs if it is for traditional purposes, making our constructed reefs ideal for the purposes of cultural activities, and aiding in the preservation of cultural heritage for Saibai residents.

                        <p>
                            The location of the reefs has been plotted to allow for the mooring of our tide sensing buoys. The sedimentary level off the coast of Saibai Island is ideal for the mooring of our buoys. Compared to a rocky seafloor, the sedimentary seabed produces a higher hydrodynamic resistance, leading to reduced drag. This helps our buoy stay anchored within an area with the highest coverage, aiding in increased efficacy of detection.

                            The construction of the reef is fairly simple, and can be carried out and maintained by a relatively unskilled team. Due to the depth being a maximum of 15m, professional diving equipment is not necessary, reducing costs to the project. This can also lead to an increased availability of local jobs for Saibai residents, as we plan to implement an upskilling project to allow residents to have independent agency over their own infrastructure.
