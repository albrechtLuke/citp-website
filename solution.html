                            The islandâ€™s lack of tidal monitoring systems and backup infrastructure makes it extremely vulnerable during emergencies. Our solution to these issues is a tide monitoring buoy which will measure the rising sea levels and act as the first point of contact to the island in emergencies. This allows the community to be notified even when cut off from the mainland. The buoys are part of a larger early warning system which will monitor, predict and warn the community about hazardous events.

                            The buoys have a spherical shape with a float around it to provide extra buoyancy. They are fluorescent yellow and made of closed-cell polyethylene foam which are a lightweight, UV resistant and saltwater resistant material. The buoys are anchored to an artificial reef made of concrete bricks via studless steel chains attached to a cast iron weight.
                        </p>

                            The buoys will be anchored in place by artificial reefs constructed of cinderblock. This supports marine biodiversity, which in turn encourages traditional activities such as cultural fishing, which upholds our major stakeholdersâ€™ interests.

                        <p>
                            The high calcium content of cinderblock helps to bolster the shell development of invertebrates, by raising the pH level and leading to more readily available carbonate ions, a necessary molecule for shell development. Additionally, the presence of artificial reefs in the path of tide pathways limits some of the wave energy being exerted upon the shoreline. This has shown promise in locations in Puerto Rico, Mauritius, and France, in reducing coastal erosion and longshore drift.

                            The interests of our stakeholders, the Saibai Islander residents and elders, are vital to the continuity of our project. Due to the principle of Aisland Custome (Island Custom), no actions can be taken on Siabai Island and its associated waterways without the input and approval of the native Peoples. This is due to the sociohistorical context of the Saibai Islanders, with Western Culture threatening to overtake their traditional ways of life. We are combatting this idea by facilitating traditional fishing and foraging, bolstered by the increase of native fauna and flora around our constructed artificial reefs. Under the Native Title Act of 1993, cultural fishing is allowed in the vicinity of reefs if it is for traditional purposes, making our constructed reefs ideal for the purposes of cultural activities, and aiding in the preservation of cultural heritage for Saibai residents.

                        <p>
                            The location of the reefs has been plotted to allow for the mooring of our tide sensing buoys. The sedimentary level off the coast of Saibai Island is ideal for the mooring of our buoys. Compared to a rocky seafloor, the sedimentary seabed produces a higher hydrodynamic resistance, leading to reduced drag. This helps our buoy stay anchored within an area with the highest coverage, aiding in increased efficacy of detection.

                            The construction of the reef is fairly simple, and can be carried out and maintained by a relatively unskilled team. Due to the depth being a maximum of 15m, professional diving equipment is not necessary, reducing costs to the project. This can also lead to an increased availability of local jobs for Saibai residents, as we plan to implement an upskilling project to allow residents to have independent agency over their own infrastructure.
